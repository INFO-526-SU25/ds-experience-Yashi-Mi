## Part 1: Experience data science outside of the classroom {#part-1-experience-data-science-outside-of-the-classroom}

I had a conversation with a Scientific Research Investigator at center for innovation in brain science who works extensively with single-nucleus RNA-seq, bulk RNA-seq, and lipidomics in neurodegenerative disease research.


## Part 2: Summarize your experience {#part-2-summarize-your-experience}

Summary: 
Through a conversation with a research investigator, I learned how single-nucleus RNA-seq and lipidomics can be used to extract meaningful insights about brain metabolism and cell-type-specific gene expression. We also discussed a recent study showing that combination therapy can significantly delay Alzheimerâ€™s-related cognitive decline. This experience highlighted the critical role of data visualization in analyzing multi-omics data and deepened my understanding of the knowledge needed for my own research.
